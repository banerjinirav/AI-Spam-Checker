# AI-Spam-Checker
I have built this custom AI model (in the form of a Python class) that uses Bayes Theorem to predict whether a message is spam or not. In our main function, we create a DataFrame object using a dataset, and we map our original messages to vectors. We also create an index for every word, so when the message is passed into the AI model, it is really just a vector of zeros and ones- ideal and relevant to the idea of matrix-based model training. We have a fit() function, which calculates the probability that some word (mapped to an index) will appear in a message, depending on the message's classification as spam or not spam. We store a vector of such probabilities. Initially, I was using the entirety of Bayes Theorem; however, I have updated this program such that it only takes the numerator of the Bayes Theorem equation, P(spam | x_vector) and P(ham | vector), since the denominator is the same: the total probability of any message having those exact words (P(x_vector)). I had to put this result through a log() function to deal with underflow issues, and I am currently working on eliminating noise to improve this model.
